# push-swap

An optimized sorting algorithm using two stacks.

## Description
The goal is to sort data on a stack with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. It requires implementing complex sorting algorithms (like radix or custom chunk-based sorts) to handle large sets of integers efficiently.

## Usage
Compile the executables:
```bash
make
```
Run push_swap with a list of numbers:
```bash
./push_swap 3 2 1 0
```
