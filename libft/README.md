# libft

A foundational C library recreating standard functions from the libc along with additional utilities.

## Description
This project is the very first at 42. It involves recoding essential functions like `ft_memset`, `ft_strlen`, `ft_memcpy`, and more. It serves as a personal toolset used in almost all subsequent C projects at the school.

## Usage
Compile the library using:
```bash
make
```
This will generate `libft.a`.
