# DSLR (Data Science Logistic Regression)

An introduction to data science and machine learning.

## Description
This project involves implementing a logistic regression from scratch to solve a classification problem (sorting students into Hogwarts houses). It includes data analysis (describing datasets) and visualization (histograms, scatter plots).

## Usage
Analyze data:
```bash
python3 describe.py [dataset.csv]
```
Train the model:
```bash
python3 logreg_train.py [dataset.csv]
```
Predict:
```bash
python3 logreg_predict.py [dataset.csv] [weights.csv]
```
