# n-puzzle

An N-puzzle solver using the A* search algorithm.

## Description
This project solves the sliding puzzle game (like the 15-puzzle) using the A* algorithm. It implements various heuristics (Manhattan distance, Linear Conflict, etc.) to find the optimal path to the solution.

## Usage
Run the solver with a puzzle file:
```bash
python3 resolve.py [puzzle_file]
```
