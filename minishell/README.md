# minishell

A simplified UNIX shell implementation.

## Description
This project is an introduction to the world of processes and file descriptors. It implements a basic shell that handles execution of commands, pipes (`|`), redirections (`<`, `>`, `>>`, `<<`), and built-ins like `cd`, `echo`, `pwd`, `export`, `unset`, `env`, and `exit`.

## Usage
Compile the shell:
```bash
make
```
Run the shell:
```bash
./minishell
```
