# fill-it

An algorithm to arrange Tetriminos in the smallest possible square.

## Description
Given a set of Tetriminos, the goal is to find the smallest square in which they can all fit without overlapping. It uses a recursive backtracking algorithm to find the optimal solution quickly.

## Usage
Compile the executable:
```bash
make
```
Run it with a map file:
```bash
./fillit [target_file]
```
